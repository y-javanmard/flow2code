**[Project Name]** is a spatial programming environment designed to orchestrate Large Language Models through an intuitive, node-based interface. Stop fighting with nested prompt strings and start mapping your AI's logic visually.

## 🧠 Why this project?

* **From "Magic" to Maps:** LLM interactions often feel like a black box. This project turns unpredictable text prompts into **deterministic visual flows**, allowing you to audit, debug, and understand exactly how your AI arrives at an answer.
* **Syntax-Free Scalability:** As LLM chains grow in complexity, code becomes a tangled mess of nested functions. By using a **node-based architecture**, you can scale your AI logic horizontally without getting lost in "if-else" hell or recursive loops.
* **The Bridge for Non-Coders:** We are entering an era where domain experts—not just engineers—need to shape AI behavior. This interface provides a **common language** for developers and creative strategists to collaborate on the same canvas.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Drag-and-Drop Orchestration:** Connect LLMs, Vector Databases, and API tools with simple visual wires.
* **Real-Time Execution Trace:** Watch data flow through your nodes in real-time to spot bottlenecks or "hallucination points."
* **Modular Node System:** Easily create custom nodes for specific tasks (e.g., Sentiment Analysis, PDF Parsing, or Image Generation).
* **Versioned Prompting:** Save and swap prompt versions within individual nodes without breaking the entire chain.
